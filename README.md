# React Native - Birthday App

purpose of this projects was for learning React Native.

It was actually fun. Since is very similar to React web, It was not that difficult :D

I used Firebase for Authentication and Firestore to store birthdays collections. I'm shocked it was TOO easy. I will use it in the future for sure
